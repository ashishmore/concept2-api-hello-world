Windows Hello-World For The Concept 2 Rowing Ergometer API

by Sam Halperin

This is an XCode project that implements
a sort of simple hello-world for communicating with Concept 2 PM4's 
over USB. I wrote this because I found the C2 API sample code a little too involved
for learning the basics of the API, and the suggestions for simple API usage were buried
in the API documentation.  It should print power output to the screen. 

IDEAS
+  Make it look for PM3's as well
+  Call the horizontal distance routine and calculate a current velocity.
